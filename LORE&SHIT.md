# ACT I
### PROLOGUE
Hunters are special warriors that kill and destroy all the beasts that lie in this world. Hunters must protect the remains of our former world. You are one of the hunters located in this destroyed place that every single human being left on this planet of fear. The city you call home. But there is another city, with worse monsters, bigger monsters, monsters beyond human comprehension. You have decided to travel there and free the city of all the evil...The Moon...The Moon is source of all evil...The Moon has always been red...or as far as you can tell... You must travel to Birmingham and slay the “Krteček from the forgotten world” for a hoonter must hoont. But to do that, you first need to escape your home, the shithole named London.

### PUSSY ENGINE
You're a cunt you know that? Imagine if I had a respawn mechanic and a health regen. You know what fuck you, no happy ending or something for you, you stay in London till you decide to fight me like a real man...or woman...or god knows what you are. Probably not even your mother knows it. What's that? Getting pissed off? Gonna cry? Whatcha gonna do about it? Kill me? I'm waiting. Pussy.
### EPILOG
You have killed that nasty insect that was stopping your way to achieving your ultimate goal. Now, leaving London, you feel fresh wind blowing on your hat. You look at the sky, your heart and blood boiling. The moon is still red. Yet that doesn't stop you. You feel determined to kill every, single, monster that crosses your path. You step outside of London's border...
CONTINUES IN ACT II
# ACT II
You still cannot believe it. For the first time you are outside of the living hell. As you look around, all you see are fields which were once full of people, villages and live...now, all you see is chaos and blood-thirsty monsters.

## FISH ENDING
- When you fish out all the fishes (bruh why)
Instead of trying to get to Krteček, you decide to stay a little while and chill with the fish. As you are looking at the moving water, you realize how easy it must be being a fish. You close your eyes and wonder what would you do with such an easy life. You fall asleep pretty quickly. When you wake up, you see only water and all the fish beside you. "Have I become a fish?" you think. First you are shoked, but after a little while you accept and embrace your new life as a fish. You no longer feel hatred or the need to kill any monsters...you feel happiness as you swim away with your new friends.
## BOSS KRTEČEK
### NEUTRAL ENDING
- (Player has slayin bosses with pussy mode ON)
As you stand there, before the very creature that may have slaughtered millions of your people, you feel...mixed...have you really done what you could done? It may be dead, but you dont feel happy...you are not...satisfied. You look at the sky once more...the moon is still red...the reason you fight, the reason you went all this way...just for nothing to change... Only one question lies in your mind..."What now?"...
### GOOD ENDING
- (Player has slayin bosses with pussy mode OFF)
As you stand there, before the very creature that may have slaughtered millions of your people, you feel...good...really good. You are the only one who was able to kill it. A smile shows on your face and a fire in your eyes. You feel alive...You feel powerfull...You feel like you could slay gods. You look at the sky filled with determination...The moon is not as bright...not as bloody red...Your purpose is being slowly achieved. You are ready to give anything...KILL anything for your homeland. You are ready to free United Kingdoms.
