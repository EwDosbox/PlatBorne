# ACT I
### PROLOGUE
Hunters are special warriors that kill and destroy all the beasts that lie in this world. Hunters must protect the remains of our former world. You are one of the hunters located in this destroyed place that every single human being left on this planet of fear. The city you call home. But there is another city, with worse monsters, bigger monsters, monsters beyond human comprehension. You have decided to travel there and free the city of all the evil...The Moon...The Moon is source of all evil...The Moon has always been red...or as far as you can tell... You must travel to Birmingham and slay the “Krteček from the forgotten world” for a hoonter must hoont. But to do that, you first need to escape your home, the shithole named London.

You're a cunt you know that? Imagine if I had a respawn mechanic and a health regen.

### EPILOG
You have killed that nasty insect that was stopping your way to achieving your ultimate goal. Now, leaving London, you feel fresh wind blowing on your hat. You look at the sky, your heart and blood boiling. The moon is still red. Yet that doesn't stop you. You feel determined to kill every, single, monster that crosses your path. You step outside of London's border...

## FISH ENDING
- **When you fish out all the fishes (bruh why)**
- The lake is comforting. You stay and fall to slumber.

- When you wake up, you see only water and all the fish beside you.
    - "Have I become a fish?"
- You are shocked, but accepting of your fate. Your prayers were heard. You no longer feel the ever-burning hatred or the need to kill any monsters...

- There is none.
- The moon still shines with its flaming red abhorrent colour
    - "Its... still bloody? Do I have to kill more? What is there left for me to kill?"
- There is none
    - "Unholy Moon! Ooooh You wretched gory Moon! Why do you torture me! I do what you please... "
    - "Yet it's all for naught!"
    - "What now?"
### GOOD ENDING
- **Player has slayed bosses with pussy mode OFF**
- The everlasting slaughterer lies on the cold moist ground, you feel it..
- The ever-escaping euphoria of another day, for once it stayed here.
- You achieved the unachievable..
    - "I did it, The night is getting shallower"

- You feel indescribable joy, your heart is about to rupture. It's here
    - "Will I be the one to free it?"
- The quest of cleansing The Great Kingdoms of Britain is once again achievable.
