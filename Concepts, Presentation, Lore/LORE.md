But there is another city, with worse monsters, bigger monsters, monsters beyond human comprehension. You have decided to travel there and free the city of all the evil...The Moon...The Moon is source of all evil...The Moon has always been red...or as far as you can tell... You must travel to Birmingham and slay the “Krteček from the forgotten world” for a hoonter must hoont. But to do that, you first need to escape your home, the shithole named London.
